 * This contains base client types used as a seed for generation.

 * there is no context, these are 'normal' method invocations on a
 * structured object graph corresponding to all databases and
 * SQLModules. That's the word way of saying -- it makes objects with methods
 * you call with `.`.
 *
 * Even though this isn't really handlebars, it will be included in
 * handlebars so avoid mustaches.
